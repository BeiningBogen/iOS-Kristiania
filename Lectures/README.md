# Lectures

Here you will find the lectures for the course. The PDF-s are exported from the Markdown files in the same folder using Deckset, so if the PDF and the Markdown file are out of sync, the Markdown file is the source of truth. Future lectures will probably be outdated as they are updated as we get to them in the semester.
